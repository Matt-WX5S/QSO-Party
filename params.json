{"name":"QSO-Pary","tagline":"Software to support the administration of the California QSO Party ham radio contest and perhaps other state QSO parties.","body":"### Welcome to the QSO Party Software Project\r\n\r\nThis project has been established to create software to support the administration of ham radio contests. In particular, we are focusing on the [California QSO party](http://cqp.org/); however, our intent is to make a system that can support multiple similar contests. We welcome contributions from the ham/programmer community.\r\n\r\nOur initial scope is to focus on these two problems:\r\n\r\n1. Log retrieval: this involves creating a website to retrieve Cabrillo file logs from the contestants, querying them for additional information that's not in the log, and checking their logs for syntactic errors.\r\n2. Log normalization: Logs are generated by numerous pieces of software, and they all have their own slightly different ways of making the files. For our scoring software to work, we need all the logs to have a common normal form. This part of the project is about morphing logs into the normal form.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
